Welcome to Xtinct! 

In choosing the theme for my React project, I decided upon animals, as they are a topic I've loved since I was little, even more so, one of my dreams was to be a zoologist and travel the world studying and helping on preservation efforts.

In my page, I wanted to show some of the endangered and extinct animals I like, and in the near future,I'd like to include information about conservation efforts or even possible reintroduction efforts.
